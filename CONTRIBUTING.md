## Pull Requests

**Currently, we are not accepting pull requests.** Cuneiform is a personal project under active development, and I prefer to maintain direct control over the codebase architecture and implementation decisions.

However, bug reports, feature suggestions, and feedback are always welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jramos57/cuneiform/issues).

## Feature Requests

If you have ideas for new features or improvements, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/jramos57/cuneiform/issues) with:

- **Use Case**: Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- **Proposed Solution**: Your suggested approach
- **Alternatives**: Any alternative solutions you've considered
- **Additional Context**: Any other relevant information

While I can't guarantee implementation of all suggestions, I value community input and will consider feature requests for future development.
